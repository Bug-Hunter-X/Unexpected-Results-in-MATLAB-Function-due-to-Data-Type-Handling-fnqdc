# Unexpected Results in MATLAB Function due to Data Type Handling

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in a MATLAB function that may lead to unexpected results or errors when dealing with specific input data types or very large numbers. The original function `myFunction.m` uses a simple conditional statement which can lead to incorrect results depending on the data type of the input. 
The `myFunctionSolution.m` file contains an improved version of the function that addresses this issue with better data type handling and error checking.  The solution incorporates explicit type checking and handling of potential overflow or underflow scenarios, ensuring robustness across diverse input scenarios. 

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `myFunction.m` file in MATLAB.
3. Run the example usages provided in the file to observe the original behavior of the function.
4. Then open the `myFunctionSolution.m` file in MATLAB.
5. Compare its behavior with the original function.

## Bug Description
The original function does not perform proper type checking and handling. For certain input types and values, it may produce incorrect results or throw an error. This occurs because the code doesn't account for potential overflow or underflow issues when dealing with very large numbers and does not explicitly handle cases of invalid input data types.

## Solution
The solution involves adding more robust error handling and checking for the data type of the input, as well as incorporating measures to prevent potential overflow issues. The solution also adds better documentation to help understand the changes and prevents potential future issues.
